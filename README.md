# **Aadit's C++ Linear Algebra Static Library**
C++ static library containing linear algebra and math functions.

## About the Project
After completing my Linear Algebra course, I truly enjoyed all the concepts and computations from the course. For this project, I decided to make a static library where it could compute the vast majority of topics on matrices and vectors, ranging from computing dot product to computing Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues, and some simple math functions. This project will help me hone my C++ skills along with practicing classes, unit testing, and creating algorithms to create the library. For documentation on functions, see the Documentation file for the list of methods for the library.
