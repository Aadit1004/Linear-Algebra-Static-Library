# **Aadit's C++ Linear Algebra Static Library**
C++ static library containing linear algebra computations.

## About the Project
After completing my Linear Algebra course, I truly enjoyed all the concepts and computations from the course. For this project, I decided to make a static library where it could compute the vast majority of topics on matrices and vectors, ranging from computing dot product to computing row echelon form of a matrix. This project will help me hone my C++ skills along with practicing classes, method and constructor overloading, unit testing, and creating algorithms to create the library. You can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/Aadit1004/Linear-Algebra-Static-Library/blob/master/LinearAlgebraLibrary/Documentation.md) for the list of methods for the library. I used the C++ language, Microsoft C++ Unit Testing Framework, and Visual Studio 2022.
